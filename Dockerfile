# Slim multi-platform build for libcolacupti.so
# Uses pre-built CUDA header images instead of full CUDA development images
# This significantly reduces build time and disk space requirements
#
# Thanks to Proton's dynamic CUPTI loading, we only need to build once
# and the library works with any CUDA version at runtime.

# CUDA header image (can be overridden at build time)
